# Collatz-Graph
A visualization of the number of iterations required to run through the collatz conjecture. 
The ability to visualize the number of approaches towards infinity and 1 added on 5 Nov 2017.
I was expecting to see that the number of negative approaches would always be more than the
positive approaches. This isn't the case and is only making me more interested in this math
problem.
A .png of this was uploaded. The interactive .html is too large for github ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I do have a ploty account that I'm considering posting here for interested parties to peruse.
